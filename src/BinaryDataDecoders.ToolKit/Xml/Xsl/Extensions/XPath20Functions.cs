3 XSL Transformations (XSLT) Functions
This section lists all of the functions in this namespace that are defined in the [XSLT 3.0] specification.

The normative definitions of these functions are in the [XSLT 3.0] specification. For convenience, a very brief, non-normative summary of each function is provided. For details, follow the link on the “Summary:” introductory text below each function.

Note that XSLT 3.0, because it is not dependent on XPath 3.1, also reproduces some of the functions specifications that appear in XPath 3.1. For an XSLT 3.0 processor that works with XPath 3.0, the normative specification in this case is the one that appears in the XSLT 3.0 specification.

accumulator-after
accumulator-after(xs:string) as item()*

Returns the post-descent value of the selected accumulator at the context node.

accumulator-before
accumulator-before(xs:string) as item()*

Returns the pre-descent value of the selected accumulator at the context node.

available-system-properties
available-system-properties() as xs:QName*

Returns a list of system property names that are suitable for passing to the system-property function, as a sequence of QNames.

collation-key
collation-key(xs:string) as xs:base64Binary

collation-key(xs:string, xs:string) as xs:base64Binary

Given a string value and a collation, generates an internal value called a collation key, with the property that the matching and ordering of collation keys reflects the matching and ordering of strings under the specified collation.

copy-of
copy-of() as item()

copy-of(item()*) as item()*

Returns a deep copy of the sequence supplied as the $input argument, or of the context item if the argument is absent.

current
current() as item()

Returns the item that is the context item for the evaluation of the containing XPath expression

current-group
current-group() as item()*

Returns the group currently being processed by an xsl:for-each-group instruction.

current-grouping-key
current-grouping-key() as xs:anyAtomicType*

Returns the grouping key of the group currently being processed using the xsl:for-each-group instruction.

current-merge-group
current-merge-group() as item()*

current-merge-group(xs:string) as item()*

Returns the group of items currently being processed by an xsl:merge instruction.

current-merge-key
current-merge-key() as xs:anyAtomicType*

Returns the merge key of the merge group currently being processed using the xsl:merge instruction.

current-output-uri
current-output-uri() as xs:anyURI?

Returns the value of the .

deep-equal
deep-equal(item()*, item()*) as xs:boolean

deep-equal(item()*, item()*, xs:string) as xs:boolean

This function assesses whether two sequences are deep-equal to each other. The function as described here extends the definition of the XPath 3.0 deep-equal to explain how it should handle maps; it is intended to replace the existing deep-equal function at some stage in the future.

document
document(item()*) as node()*

document(item()*, node()) as node()*

Provides access to XML documents identified by a URI.

element-available
element-available(xs:string) as xs:boolean

Determines whether a particular instruction is or is not available for use. The function is particularly useful for calling within an [xsl:]use-when attribute (see ) to test whether a particular is available.

function-available
function-available(xs:string) as xs:boolean

function-available(xs:string, xs:integer) as xs:boolean

Determines whether a particular function is or is not available for use. The function is particularly useful for calling within an [xsl:]use-when attribute (see ) to test whether a particular is available.

json-to-xml
json-to-xml(xs:string) as document-node()

json-to-xml(xs:string, map(*)) as document-node()

Parses a string supplied in the form of a JSON text, returning the results in the form of an XML document node.

key
key(xs:string, xs:anyAtomicType*) as node()*

key(xs:string, xs:anyAtomicType*, node()) as node()*

Returns the nodes that match a supplied key value.

regex-group
regex-group(xs:integer) as xs:string

Returns the string captured by a parenthesized subexpression of the regular expression used during evaluation of the xsl:analyze-string instruction.

snapshot
snapshot() as item()

snapshot(item()*) as item()*

Returns a copy of a sequence, retaining copies of the ancestors and descendants of any node in the input sequence, together with their attributes and namespaces.

stream-available
stream-available(xs:string?) as xs:boolean

Determines, as far as possible, whether a document is available for streamed processing using xsl:source-document.

system-property
system-property(xs:string) as xs:string

Returns the value of a system property

type-available
type-available(xs:string) as xs:boolean

Used to control how a stylesheet behaves if a particular schema type is or is not available in the static context.

unparsed-entity-public-id
unparsed-entity-public-id(xs:string) as xs:string

unparsed-entity-public-id(xs:string, node()) as xs:string

Returns the public identifier of an unparsed entity

unparsed-entity-uri
unparsed-entity-uri(xs:string) as xs:anyURI

unparsed-entity-uri(xs:string, node()) as xs:anyURI

Returns the URI (system identifier) of an unparsed entity

xml-to-json
xml-to-json(node()?) as xs:string?

xml-to-json(node()?, map(*)) as xs:string?

Converts an XML tree, whose format corresponds to the XML representation of JSON defined in this specification, into a string conforming to the JSON grammar.

4 XQuery Update Functions
This section lists all of the functions in this namespace that are defined in the [XQuery Update 1.0] specification.

The normative definitions of these functions are in the [XQuery Update 1.0] specification. For convenience, a very brief, non-normative summary of each function is provided. For details, follow the link on the “Summary:” introductory text below each function.

put
put(node(), xs:string) as empty-sequence()

Stores a document or element to the location specified by $uri. This function is normally invoked to create a resource on an external storage system such as a file system or a database.

The external effects of fn:put are implementation-defined, since they occur outside the domain of XQuery. The intent is that, if fn:put is invoked on a document node and no error is raised, a subsequent query can access the stored document by invoking fn:doc with the same URI.
