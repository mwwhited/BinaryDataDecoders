#### Public Constructor - FileEntry

#####  Parameters

 - ReadOnlySpan < byte > span 

#### Public ReadOnly Field - Track

##### Comments

 <summary>
 Track of first track/sector list sector.  If this is a deleted file, this byte contains $FF
 and the original track number is copied to last byte of the file name field(BYTE $20).  If this
 byte contains a $00, the entry is assumed to have never been used and is available for use.
 (This means that track 0 can never be used for data entry if the DOS image is wiped off the diskette.)
