〰6:           GSV - Satellites in view
〰7:           This is one of the sentences commonly emitted by GPS units.

〰9:           These sentences describe the sky position of a UPS satellite in view. Typically they’re shipped in a group of 2 or 3.

〰17:          Sentence number, 1-9 of this GSV message within current group
〰18:          total number of satellites in view (leading zeros sent)
〰19:          satellite ID number (leading zeros sent)
〰20:          elevation in degrees (-90 to 90) (leading zeros sent)
〰21:          azimuth in degrees to true north (000 to 359) (leading zeros sent)
〰22:          SNR in dB (00-99) (leading zeros sent) more satellite info quadruples like 4-7 n) checksum
〰23:          Example:
〰24:              $GPGSV,3,1,11,03,03,111,00,04,15,270,00,06,01,010,00,13,06,292,00*74

〰28:          Some GPS receivers may emit more than 12 quadruples (more than three GPGSV sentences),
〰29:              even though NMEA-0813 doesn’t allow this. (The extras might be WAAS satellites, for example.)
〰30:              Receivers may also report quads for satellites they aren’t tracking, in which case the SNR field
〰31:              will be null; we don’t know whether this is formally allowed or not.

〰40:          GSV - Satellites in View shows data about the satellites that the unit might be able to find based on its viewing mask and almanac
〰41:          data. It also shows current ability to track this data. Note that one GSV sentence only can provide data for up to 4 satellites and
〰42:          thus there may need to be 3 sentences for the full information. It is reasonable for the GSV sentence to contain more satellites than
〰43:          GGA might indicate since GSV may include satellites that are not used as part of the solution. It is not a requirment that the GSV
〰44:          sentences all appear in sequence. To avoid overloading the data bandwidth some receivers may place the various sentences in totally
〰45:          different samples since each sentence identifies which one it is.
〰46:  
〰47:          The field called SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in the NMEA standard is often referred to as signal strength. SNR is an indirect but
〰48:          more useful value that raw signal strength. It can range from 0 to 99 and has units of dB according to the NMEA standard, but the
〰49:          various manufacturers send different ranges of numbers with different starting numbers so the values themselves cannot necessarily
〰50:          be used to evaluate different units. The range of working values in a given gps will usually show a difference of about 25 to 35
〰51:          between the lowest and highest values, however 0 is a special case and may be shown on satellites that are in view but not being tracked.
